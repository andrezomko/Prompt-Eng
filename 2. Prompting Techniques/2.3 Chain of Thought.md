### Example

Instead of asking a broad question like:

> “What are the advantages and disadvantages of working from home?”

We can approach the topic through a series of connected prompts:

- “List three reasons why people might prefer working from home."
- "For each reason you mentioned, explain the benefits and positive effects on the individual and/or the organization."
- "Now, consider the challenges of working from home. Identify three potential disadvantages or negative effects."
- "For each of these challenges, discuss how individuals and organizations can mitigate or address them.”
