### Quizzing Yourself

Another way to use LLMs as a study tool is to quiz yourself. If you have an upcoming calculus test, you could simply ask:

```
Generate 5 calculus I quiz questions for me:
```

And the model will generate 5 questions for you to answer.

```
1. What is the derivative of y = x3?
2. Evaluate the indefinite integral of x3 + 5x2 + 7x + 4.
3. What is the product rule for derivatives?
4. Find the equation of the line tangent to y = x2 at the point (4, 16).
5. What is the second derivative of y = x4?
```

There are probably other ways to use LLMs to study. Many learning companies like Duolingo and Quizlet are implementing LLMs into their products.
